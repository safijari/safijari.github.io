where over the last three years I&rsquo;ve played a leading role in computer vision and machine learning initiatives.
Specifically I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time building object detection and OCR systems on home grown and curated datasets.
I&rsquo;ve also played an instrumental role in putting the computer vision models and pipeline in production
and scaling it to match the needs of our growing customer base. Outside of engineering work I also mentor my colleagues both in how to become better software
engineers as well as how to balance the various aspects of work.</p><p>My history has been a bit meandering.
