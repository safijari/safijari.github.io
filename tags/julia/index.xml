I later realized that this was a follow up to the author&amp;rsquo;s previous article called &amp;ldquo;Should You Jump Python&amp;rsquo;s Ship and Move to Julia?&amp;rdquo;.
Upon more investigation it was clear that the author (whose name is Emmett) is a Julia evangelist and he seems very competent in Julia but based on the articles maybe relatively new to python.</description></item></channel></rss>
